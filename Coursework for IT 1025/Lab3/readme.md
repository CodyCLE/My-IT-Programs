# Executive Summary
  In this Lab, I will be dicussing various topics like different types of software, virtualization, cloud-computing as well as exploring different career opportunies within the Information Technology field.
# Software
  1. Software, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are examples of Application Software. They are essentially a collection of data and code that runs on a computer to perform specific tasks. Anti-virus software like AVG and Norton Anti-virus are examples of Utility software and are used to help manage, maintain and control computer resources. Finally, Windows 10 and Linux are examples of Operating System Software. They are used to provide an interface between the user and the hardware. 
  2. Enterprise resource planning or ERP software is a series of applications that can help automate your business process. This type of software became popular as technology advanced, allowing both small and large business to lower costs and increase profitability. An example of an ERP software is Microsoft SQL.
  3. Virtualization allows users to run two or more operating systems on one computer. Businesses can usually benefit from this in several ways such as, reduced hardware costs is one of the most beneficial. According to Learning Solutions, IDC reported a 40% reduction in hardware and software costs for IT departments that adopted a server virtualization strategy. Another reason is you’d increase productivity due to having fewer machines to manage and maintain, which in turn would free up the IT staff and allow them to focus their energy on other things. Having fewer machines running means you’re using less power and in turn, lowers the companies monthly electric bill.  
# Virtualization 
  1. Quality Assurance, Software testing, cost effective means of multiple computers.
  2. According to Networkworld.com, 
  > "The hypervisor drives the concept of virtualization by allowing the physical host machine to operate multiple virtual machines as guests to help maximize the effective use of computing resources such as memory, network bandwidth and CPU cycles."

# Python
  1. Pseudo-code is used by programmers to allow them to foxus on the code itself rather than worrying about the syntax.
  2. Compiled langauge are languages like C#, C++, Java, etc. that are first ran through a compiler so that a computer can read and interpret it. Whereas interpreted languages are interpreted in real-time using the original source code.
  
# Career Exploration
  ### Certifications
  1. CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) is an IT workforce certification that applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices to prevent, detect and combat cybersecurity threats.
  ### Certificates
  1. Cybersecurity Post Degree Professional Certificate
  ### Co-ops / Internships
  1. To become co-op ready you need to have at least 12 credit hours or coursework completed and at least 2 courses completed in that field of study. Co-ops allow students to experience real world applications of their field and it provides them with a means of a more in-depth learning.
  ### Industry Associations / Student Organizations under Career Exploration
  1. The Cybersecurity Club prepares students for CCDC or Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition system. 
# Conclusion
  Lab 3 focused primarily on the differences between software operating systems, virtualization and cloud computing while also touching base on different career opportunities within the IT community.
