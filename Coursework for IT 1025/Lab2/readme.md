# Executive Summary
  I will be discussing information about the differences between HDD and SSD, upgrading RAM, as well as the difference between 64-bit and 32-bit systems.
# Information Systems for Business
  ### Hard Drives
    The difference between Latency and transfer rates is as follows:
    1.) Latency is the amount of time it takes for the drive to find the location of the data.
    2.) Transfer rate is the speed at which the har drive transfers files to and from the drive itself.
  ## Solid State Drives
    Solid state drives are becoming the norm in all high-end computers. They not only last longer, but they also have superior read/write speeds making them ideal for storage and dedicated boot drives. Unlike it's predecessor, the hard disk drive, an SSD does not contain any moving parts making it less prone to failure.
  ## RAM
    Increasing the RAM on your computer is one of the most beneficial upgrades one can do to increase the speed of an outdated computer. Upgrading the RAM makes your computer able to have more applications opened at the same time and helps to keep most important and most used data in RAM so the access times will be faster.
    64 bit and 32 bit is commonly used to describe the processor architecture. 32 bit systems are becoming outdated, they were primarily used when Windows 7/8 was the latest operating system amd cam only store 4,294,967,296 bytes while 64 bit system can store 18,446,744,073,709,551,6146 bytes.
# Hardware
## Hardware: ALU and the Control Unit
  ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit and is responsible for the calculation jobs within the computer while the Control Unit is resposible for regulating the flow of data to the various parts of the CPU.
## Hardware: CPU, Input & Output
### CPU
  Also known as the central processing unit, which calculates the information
### Input
  Converts physical input, such as a mouse and keyboard to information for the computer to use.
### Output
  Converts information to physical output from the computer, such as monitors and speakers.
## Hardware: Logic Gates and Circuits
  A truth gate displays information about certain logical expressions using a table with columns and rows. NAND gates are similar to AND gates except that NAND gates are followed by a NOT gate (inverter).
## Hardware: IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
  The purpose of IEEE is to inspire technoloigcal innovation for the benefit of humanity. It is a global community to promote the safe and ethical standards of technology and their respective devices.
# Data Representation: Numeric Conversions
  Decimal represents any number between 0-9, Binary represents any number using 2 digits (0-1) and a Hexadecimal represents any number using both numbers and characters.
## Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation
  #ff016b could possibly be considered as problematic to someone who is color-blind to red hues. But in general color schemes are dependent on the business. Primarily, when developing a website you should use a responsive website design that changes by screen size, using alt-text for images, text-to-speech accomidations, etc. That way persons with disability can equally access your website and services.
# Conclusion
  Lab 2 was interesting as I had recently replaced my HDD with a new M.2 NVMe SSD and upgraded my RAM from 8gb to 16gb. I enjoyed reading the articles as they went more in-depth about the hardware specifications.
