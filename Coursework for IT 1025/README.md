# Executive Summary
  In Lab 1 for IT1025, I will be discussing different information system components, aspects of client-servers and cloud computing.
# Information System Components 
  There is a correlation between pumping gas and the five systems of Information (hardware, software, data, people, and process). First on the list, hardware, is probably the easiest as this pertains to the overall gas pumping system the customer interacts with and the teller’s computer on the inside. Software being the program the hardware runs on (between the pump and the system). Data would be the information such as the price of gas or how many gallons is being dispensed. People, like the teller or delivery truck driver. Finally, Process would be the series of steps the gas station takes in order to make a profit and provide its services to the customers.

### - Client-Server Architecture 
  According to CodeConquest:
  "Website scripts run in one of two places – the client side, also called the front-end, or the server side, also called the back-end."
Since client side development is primarily done in Javascript, I'm assuming that a desktop application like Github Desktop does not use a webpage to load the script. Instead, will continue to use the ASP.NET or similar microsoft lanuage for the front-end management.

### - Cloud Computing
Github, which is owned by Microsoft, is a cloud-based source code management system. It stores/hosts developer source code to allow other programmers to clone, modify, and add to the existing code.

I use several different cloud enviroments such as OneDrive, Google Drive, and Evernote to keep backups files and notes.
# Conclusion
Lab 1 allowed me to familarize myself with formatting files in GitHub as well as the different Information System components that are used in everyday society.
