# Introduction to Networking
### Networking Hardware
  1. A switch  allows you to control and configure multiple devices seperately.
  2. A router allows you to not only control and configure every device connected but you can ultimately set specific perimeters that each device abbides by.
### Network Topologies
  1. Mesh networks are an example of single point failure due to the way it is configured, if one node should fail, the rest will noot transmit the signal.
  2. Personally, i'm a fan of mesh networks. If you use a name brand setup and they are properly configured, they  are actually quite reliable. 
### Data Transmission under Introduction to Networking
  1. Packet --> Unit of data
  2. Packet-switching --> Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
  3. IP Address --> Unique identifying number 
  4. DNS --> Directory of IP address common names 
  5. Protocol --> Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
### NSA/CSS
  1. The NSA primary mission is to support military service members around the world. They provide intel to military ops and ensure communication is both stable and secure. They’re directly responsible for providing secure wireless and wired connections to every branch of service. This includes the sharing of information between our NATO allies and other coalition forces.   
# Cybersecurity and Encryption
### Information Systems Security
  1. If I was part of the Amazon chat, confidentiality would be verifying the users account to make sure I am indeed talking to the correct person. Integrity would be similar to confidentiality as I would need to verify, I am talking to the account holder and make sure there has been no unauthorized use. Availability would be making sure customer support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
  2. Logging into Facebook (via email address and password), using the ATM (via pin code), unlocking cell phone (via passcode or pin code). 
  3. ACL stands for “Access Control List” and RBAC stands for “Role-based Access Control”. For large scale usage or those with multiple users, it is recommended to go with RBAC. This is because the administrator assigns users a role, such as Reader, Editor, and Admin, which in turn, gives them access to certain files. 
  4. To send encrypted messages you need 3 things: text, a public key and a private key. The person who is receiving the message will send the public key to the sender. Once the message is sent, the person receiving the message will use the private key to decrypt the text. 
### Cryptography 
  1. I encrypted my first and last name, which came out to "iujg mktzxe".
  2. A Polyalphabetic cipher is a cipher that focuses on substitution. 
  3. I used the sentence "my first name is cody" and used "cody" as the shift word. When encrypted, it seemed to shift the letters used to the left.
   
### Brute-Force
  1. A brute force attack is simply using a computer to do the work by trying as many username and passwords combinations as possible to eventually crack the account.
