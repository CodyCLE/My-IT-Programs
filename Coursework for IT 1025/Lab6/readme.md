# Executive Summary
  1. In Lab 6 I will be discussing various topics such as internet security, TCP/IP, and seceral types of markup languages.
# Internet Architecture
  1. An IP address is a unique string of numbers that identifies each computer and device using the internet. Currently, IPv4 is on its way of being phased out to IPv6. One of the main reasons is that IPv4 will eventually run out of possible number combinations.
  2. ICANN allocates the IP addresses in “blocks” for the 5 regional internet registries.
### TCP/IP
  1. TCP/IP specifies how the data will be exchanged over the internet using end to end communications.
  2. TCP/IP does use the client/server model. What this means is that a machine provides a service, for example, sending a webpage or web-based application to another computer.
  3. Gmail and Outlook would be an example of applications running on that specific layer, as they both could use POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP.
### Internet Security
  1. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transport Protocol. An example of HTTP using the client-server model would be accessing a webpage or your e-mail.
  2. HTTP is primarily based on the TCP/IP protocols mentioned earlier in the lab. 
  3. Everyone should take the time to secure their browser due to the overwhelming amount of spyware and malware on the internet these days.
  4. One of the risks mentioned in the article is Java. Essentially, this programming language is used to run applet's within the browsers enviroment. This is ussually meant to make websites and applications more interactive. However, this can backfire and if not properly configured could eventually be used to infect your computer.
# Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
  1. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web back in 1989 and founded the W3C.
  2. Web Design. Accessability options are extremely important when it comes to web design. Configuring a website to include the different options for those with disabilities not only can increase the foot traffic of the website itself but it more importantly lets people utilize the site.
### HTML5 and CSS
  1. Since we had spent time in class creating a basic webpage I decided to go ahead and use that for my example. It includes all of the basic HTML headers and tags as well as some CSS to alter the look of the text/images.
### HTML and XML
  1. HTML and XML are both considered markup languages. HTML is generally used for the presentation of data, whereas the purpose of XML is to store and transfer said data.
### Components of a URL
The URL for W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/html/stml_intro.asp), has a Scheme, Domain name, and a File path: 
  1. Scheme: The scheme is an element that every URL begins with and tells the browser how you’re connected to the website. In this case, the “https://” in the URL stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure” 
  2. Domain names: Domains are typically broken down into 3 parts. The sub-domain is the text before the websites name (usually www. or m.), the second-level is the websites name (w3schools), and the top-level domain is the text after the websites name (usually .com or .org). 
  3. File path: Are a specific page on the website. They are used to instruct the browser to go to that page. 
# Conclusion
  1. Lab 6 focuses on the various topics on internet programming, HTML/CSS, and TCP/IP protocols. This lab helps lay the groundwork for many aspiring web developers and network fundementals by covering the differences between several markup languages and network protocols.
