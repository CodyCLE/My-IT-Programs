# Project
  I have included several screenshots of the application form along with the confirmation email from the Career Center. Lastly, I have also uploaded a copy of my current resume for an entry level IT Specialist job that I recently applied for. After I have gained some actual job experience, I plan to use my military background and education to apply for a Government Cybersecurity position.
# Conclusion
  I have enjoyed taking your class (IT 1025) this Summer semester. The two most important thing I learned while taking your class was how to effectivly use GitHub and about the differnt job opportunties available in the information technology career field and I can't thank you enough for that. I hope to take another one of your classes in the near future.
