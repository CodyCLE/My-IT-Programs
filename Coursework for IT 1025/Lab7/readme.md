# Executive Summary
  In Lab 7, I will discuss why file compression is useful, define and implement various Python code, and talk about UML or unified modeling language.
# File Compression
  1. File compression is particularly useful for saving disk space and it reduces the amount of data needed to store data. According to TechWalla, you can compress a file to around 90% of it's original size.
  2. Because SVG is a lossless image type, it can be resized to fit any screen without distortion. After doing some research many sources indicate that as long as the SVG image has been compressed it is the preferred image type to use for web development even when compared to PNG/JPG. This is due to the faster loading times and saved bandwidth. 
# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  1. The Shark classes method would be what is indented underneath it. In this case it is **print("The shark is swimming.")**
  2. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data.
  3. Although the two are easily confused, the easiest way to explain it is that a class is simply a template for objects. They define the objects properties and default value. 

# Unified Modeling Language (UML)
  1. OMG stands for Object Management Group and is an international non-profit technology standards consortium. UML was created to bring a common lanuage meant to create rich visual designs of software systems.
  Object > Sammy
  Class > swim(self)
  Abstraction > shark
  Encapsulation > definition of a shark
  Inheritance > specific type of shark

# Conclusion
  In lab 7 we learned the importance of compressing files to save storage space and using python to create small programs. Python uses a what is known as object oriented programming or OOP. OOP is seemingly the foundation for several programming languages such as Java, python, and C#. Near the end of the lab we also learned the importance of creating Lucidcharts for class diagrams and used the information we had learned to create our very own for one of the shark classes. Overall, I found this lab enjoyable as it touched base with several topics that I find interesting.
