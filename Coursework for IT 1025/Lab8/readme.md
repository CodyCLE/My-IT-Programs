# Executive Summary
In Lab 8 I will be going of the fundamentals of relational data, the importance of big data, SQL and SQL injections, as well as information about intellectual property and AMC's code of ethics.
# Data, Information and Knowledge
  ### Relational Data
  1. According to a few sources online, Data is a set representation of plain facts, while Information is a message with a meaning. Meaning that information may not always be true and should not be interepted as such. Knowledge on the other hand is information processed in the mind of each individual.
  2. The primary key more than likely will be the customers account id number.
  3. The customers and orders table would be related by the customers account ID and the customers order number.
  4. The foreign key in the orders table would be the Customer ID.
  5. It is important to utilize date fields in most databases because it allows you to quickly sort through the data chronologically by date.
  ### Big Data
  1. The four V's of big data stand for Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Velocity. Volume is the scale of data, Variety is the different forms of data, Velocity is the analysis of streaming data, and Veracity is the uncertainy of data.
  2. Probably the most logical need for big data is the technology industry. It allows companies to analyze the information (trends, user interaction, ads) and make decisions based on that information. One company in particular that uses big data to improve upon there technology would be Google.
# Structured Query Language
  1. RDBMS stands for Relation Database Management System. This software is primarily used to create and manage databases based on the relational model. The purpose of SQL is to communicate with a database, statements are used to perform a variety of tasks to update and retrieve data.
  2. Employees and Orders tables: The primary key for the Employees table is the EmployeeID while the primary key for the Orders table is OrderID. The foriegn key is the EmployeeID and is placed in the Orders table.
# SQL Injections
SQL Injections is a type of injection attack that makes it possible to execute malicious SQL statements within the database. They can be a large security threat to many companies that use SQL databases. There are many ways to prevent SQL injections, companies like Cisco currently have an Intrusion Prevention System in place that can detect and prevent many types of SQL attacks. Another type of network defense is an inspection of the application layer protocol, which performs a packet inspection on the firewall. 
# Ethical and Legal Implications
  ### Code of Ethics
  1. The purpose of the Code of Ethics is primarily to inspire and guide ethical conduct for all IT and computer professionals. AMC created this code to hold everyone to a set of standards and take action when necessary. 
  2. The code of ethics sets the standards and guidelines for all IT members while the acceptable use policy (AUP) has guidelines set by the creators, admins or company.
  3. Google Maps AUP: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/aup/ seems pretty generalized. It states that the customer shall agree to not allow third parties to use their services to violate legal rights, promote illegal activity, disable or interfere with the Google Maps service and so forth.
# Intellectual Property
  1. WIPO stands for World Intellectual Property Organization and it's purpose is to develop a balanced international intellectual property system for everyone. It sets standards and even rewards users for creativity and innovation.
  2. You obtain Copyrights automatically whenever you create something, whether it be a song, poem, or graphic. However, if you would like to register your copyright you can official do so with the US Copyright Office. The benefits of doing this include a public record of ownership, presumption of ownership, the ability to enforce copyrights by filing a lawsuit, and most importantly you become eligable to receive statutory damages from said lawsuit. It might be important for me to copyright my image because someone may decide to use it to promote themselves or there business from the work I created.
  3. The image may be used to promote my business and if it's a registered of my company, it becomes brand specific. It protects the image from being used by others for their own benefit or gain.
  
# Information Collection
COPPA, FERPA, and HIPAA set the standards and guidelines for parties to restrict and collect only certain information from protected individuals. In this case, COPPA, restricts the information or data that third-parties may collect on children under the age of 13. These policies are meant for the protection of both the parent and child.
# Conclusion
In this Lab, I talked about the fundamentals of relational data, why big data is important for technology, SQL and SQL injections, AMC's code of ethics and intellectual property. Learning the fundamentals of SQL databases was a fun and meaningful task for this lab as it may be used in prospective jobs in the future. Overall I found this assignment enjoyable and have learned a lot about the topics mentioned above.
