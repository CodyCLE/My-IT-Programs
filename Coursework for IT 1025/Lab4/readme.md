  ### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
  Raster graphics are comprised of pixels, like JPG, PNG, and GIF, while vector graphics are composed of paths. Vector graphics are useful because they are resolution dependent, meaning they can be resized without losing quality.
  ### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
  Lossy compression produces a close match to the original data after decompression while lossless produces an exact match to the original.
  ### File Formats
  JPG, PNG, and GIF are all examples of raster graphics so they're pixel based. One prime difference between JPG and PNG is that PNG graphics allow for lossless transparency which is useful for making logo's or other graphic designs.
  ### File Properties
  1. I've made plenty of graphics in the past for friends and family. However, I did not use VectR, instead I used a mixture of Photoshop and 3D Paint. A total of 4 layers were used in making the logo.
  2. I have compressed it down to 12.50 kb and it opens with Paint 3D (as that is my default for editing graphics)
